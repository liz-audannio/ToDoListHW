To Do List

Let's create a simple to do application

Show an unordered list of to do's
Show an input to enter a new to do
Show a button to add a to  do. When the button is clicked:

The text from the input box is used to add a list item to the bottom of the list
The text from the input box is cleared out.

When the user clicks on a list item, it is removed

Extra Credit: - When a list item is clicked, cross it out, then remove it after 1 second.

**Submit: A link to your github repo for the project as well as a screenshot of the project working in the browser
